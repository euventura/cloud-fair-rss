    <p>I wish you reading this a lot of blessings, rest, and acknowledgement of your hard work. May all your wishes come true :)</p>
<p>Here are my wishes and goals for 2026.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passing all my exams. I really wanna be done with my Bachelor’s degree as soon as possible to be able to start the Masters, and I can’t get there quickly if I fail, or once again postpone, exams. I really wanna make a dent into the list of classes I still have to do.</li>
<li>Good health! I never know what new rock will be dropped in my path. I have some challenges to tackle already.</li>
<li>Keeping up and deepening the friendships I have.</li>
<li>Making more progress in my Pilates training and working towards running 5km on the treadmill.</li>
<li>Finding a new job and new apartment in the area I wanna move to.</li>
<li>More effort spent on creativity! I wanna draw and paint more; my notebook stuff has also really slowed down for over a month now.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t have everything I want, but I basically have everything I wanted two years ago :) now a new job, stability in my health and a new apartment, and I’ve reached a good new milestone in my life.</p>
