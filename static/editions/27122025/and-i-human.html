    <p>Dear me,</p>
<p>AI makes smart people even smarter, yet it gives them the feeling that they’re becoming dumber.
That as a form of noticing.</p>
<p>AI makes foolish people even more foolish, yet it gives them the feeling that they’re becoming smarter.<br />
That as a form of delusion.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I'm in the first group.<br />
Sometimes I’m aware that I’m in the second.<br />
I try to keep myself in the first group more often and for longer.</p>
<p>I need a certain foundation within myself to be able to do that.<br />
I need an oar, the skill to row, or even an engine to steer the boat I'm standing on.</p>
<p>I have to find a way to reach the shore, or at least get close to it.<br />
If not, I will be swallowed when we reach the waterfall.</p>
<p>Hữu Phong.</p>
