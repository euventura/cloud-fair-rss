    <p>Just a few personal thoughts.<br />
Notes to myself, to people who use and love this app everyday. <br />
This is not an attack or hostility toward Obsidian or the talented engineers who created it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Obsidian’s source code is closed. <br />
Its macOS app is distributed as a .dmg file without any checksum. <br />
Although Obsidian has an iOS version, it isn’t distributed through the Mac App Store. It’s unclear whether this is a design choice or due to technical or policy constraints. It's a point worth questioning.<br />
Since Obsidian isn’t distributed through the Mac App Store, it isn’t required to use sandboxing, <br />
Combined with the fact that its source code isn’t public, <br />
And that many users rely heavily on Community Plugins (some of my friends have customized their Obsidian setups so much that I barely recognize the app), <br />
And that users often grant Obsidian access to sensitive folders like iCloud Drive, Documents, or Desktop (protected by TCC or not), etc to open Vault. <br />
To me, this represents a very serious risk.</p>
<p>I trust the Obsidian team. <br />
It’s an app built on good philosophy to me. <br />
I’ve used it for quite some time, mainly on iOS, with almost all Core Plugins disabled and never touching any Community Plugins. <br />
Yet I’ve always felt that something wasn’t quite right.</p>
<p>This situation is somewhat similar to VSCode.<br />
But VSCode is open-source,  and it benefits from stricter review systems, a larger user base, and much more attention overall. <br />
Even so, extensions still carry enormous potential risk.</p>
<p>I believe Obsidian will gradually become an indispensable part of many people’s work and life. <br />
I like Obsidian’s icon because it gives me the feeling that I’m sharpening a rough stone into the shape I desire, a metaphor for turning collected knowledge into applicable understanding. <br />
But I also hope that the sharp edges and potential risks of this “sharpening tool” receive more attention, so that we don't cut our hands or bleed during that process.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p> Hữu Phong.</p>
