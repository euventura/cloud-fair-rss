    <p>I re-registered for Bear Blog and also upgraded to Bear Blog lifetime today.</p>
<p>Wait, why re-register?</p>
<p>I’ve created account multiple times, did nothing, wrote nothing, then deleted the account, maybe two or three times, just repeating the loop that I don't even know clearly why. I think I’ve thought a lot, partly anxious, and partly afraid. I’m not sure what it is, I just know I’m trying to wrestle with a vague, shapeless anxiety that I can’t fully grasp.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be like that anymore. I want to try facing it, overcoming it, by writing things down.</p>
<p>Someone once said that <em>things posted on the Internet will exist forever, they can’t ever be fully erased, only harder to find</em>. I agree with that, so I also want to post a few things that I think would be interesting to “carve” into the Internet. That’s just a small part of what I want to write down, instead of letting it swirl around in my head for too long and destroy me everyday.</p>
<p>So, this time, I recreated my Bear Blog page. Luckily, still no one else had registered the address “phong.bearblog.dev”, so I took it back.</p>
<p>I used to think I could use my personal website. I know Astro and I could easily build my own blog site. But unlike before, this time I wanted to use a blogging platform, and that platform is Bear.</p>
<p>Why Bear ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ?</p>
<p>Because it’s cute, really, really cute.</p>
<p>The community that shares posts is so “dense”. I’ve read so many posts in <a href='https://bearblog.dev/discover/'>Discover</a> from people I couldn’t find any other info about, except for their Bear Blog page. I was surprised, why are such interesting people only writing on this platform?</p>
<p>Especially Herman, I really want to give him a huge thanks and appreciation. The way he’s guided and built Bear Blog has taught me so many valuable lessons in building products. I’ve read and reread his posts many many times, especially these three: <a href='https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/'>My product is my garden</a>, <a href='https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/'>Building software to last forever</a>, and <a href='https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/'>The Bear Manifesto</a>. I believe in him, I believe in Bear Blog, and believe in this community.</p>
<p>I’ve read a lot and learned a lot, it just wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t write something and share something. Both literally and figuratively, that’s what I told myself.</p>
<p>So, create an account!!<br />
And upgrade right away!!</p>
<p>I chose Lifetime instead of monthly or yearly, even had a 50% discount code for those registering from Southeast Asian countries. Pretty cool that it worked for this plan.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t really like the word "Lifetime" when registering or buying software (or services), because I understand how hard, serious, and responsible it is for those building the software. I prefer to call it "Believer", and it should be 10 years instead of forever (haha). Not because I just registered that I think this, I’d gladly register again after 10 years or donate the same if 10 years from now, we’re still lucky enough to “meet” each other. Truly from the bottom of my heart. Anyway, that’s just my weird thought as a user.</p>
<p>Today is September 5th, Friday, in my country this is the day when students all over the country return to school to start a new academic year. And for me, it’s the same. I’m starting a new blog today, have fun in <a href='/markdown-format-testing'>testing</a> whole day, and write this first post.</p>
<p>With strong and brave, I hope I’ll overcome myself, like before, conquer the things I’m facing, and have lots of interesting things I can write down and share.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Hữu Phong.</p>
